				<article>
					<p>In Python, variables are used to store data. They act as placeholders for different types of information, such as numbers, text, or more complex data structures.</p>
					<p>Here's how you can define a variable in Python:</p>
					<div>
						<pre><code>variable_name = value</code></pre>
						<strong>For example:</strong>
						<pre><code>age = 25
	name = "John"
	is_student = True</code></pre>
					</div>
					<p>Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Python infers the type based on the value assigned to it.</p>
					<p>Variables can be reassigned to different values:</p>
					<pre><code>age = 30</code></pre>
					<p>And variables can hold different types of data:</p>
					<pre><code>age = "thirty"</code></pre>
					<strong>Python variable names:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_)</li>
						<li>Can contain letters, digits (0-9), or underscores</li>
						<li>Cannot be a keyword or built-in function name</li>
						<li>Are case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are three different variables)</li>
						<li>Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful to indicate the purpose of the variable.</li>
					</ul>

				<header>Data types</header>
				<article>
					<p>In Python, data types represent the kind of value a variable can hold. Understanding data types is fundamental for writing Python programs.</p>
					<p>Here are some common data types in Python:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Integer:</strong> Whole numbers, e.g., 5, -3, 0.</li>
						<li><strong>Float:</strong> Numbers with a decimal point, e.g., 3.14, -0.5.</li>
						<li><strong>String:</strong> Text enclosed within single (' ') or double (" ") quotes, e.g., 'hello', "world".</li>
						<li><strong>Boolean:</strong> Represents True or False values, used in logical operations and conditions.</li>
						<li><strong>List:</strong> Ordered collection of items, enclosed within square brackets ([ ]).</li>
						<li><strong>Tuple:</strong> Similar to lists, but immutable (cannot be changed), enclosed within parentheses (( )).</li>
						<li><strong>Dictionary:</strong> Collection of key-value pairs, enclosed within curly braces ({ }).</li>
						<li><strong>Set:</strong> Unordered collection of unique items, enclosed within curly braces ({ }).</li>
						<li><strong>None:</strong> Represents the absence of a value or a null value.</li>
					</ul>
					<strong>Here are some examples:</strong>
					<div>
						<pre><code>
	age = 25  # Integer
	height = 5.9  # Float
	name = 'John'  # String
	is_student = True  # Boolean
	my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # List
	my_tuple = (4, 5, 6)  # Tuple
	my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}  # Dictionary
	my_set = {1, 2, 3}  # Set
	empty_value = None  # None
							</code></pre>
					</div>
					<p>Understanding and utilizing these data types efficiently is crucial for writing effective Python code.</p>

				<header>Loops</header>
				<article>
					<p>In Python, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over data structures.</p>
					<p>Types of loops in Python:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>for loop:</strong> Executes a block of code for each item in a sequence.</li>
						<li><strong>while loop:</strong> Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</li>
						<li><strong>nested loop:</strong> A loop inside another loop, useful for iterating over multidimensional data structures.</li>
						<li><strong>list comprehension:</strong> A concise way to create lists based on existing lists.</li>
						<li><strong>generator:</strong> A special type of iterator that generates values on-the-fly, saving memory.</li>
					</ul>
					
				
					<p>Here's how a <strong>for loop</strong> works:</p>
					<div>
						<pre><code>
		# Syntax:
		for item in sequence:
		# Code block to be executed for each item
						</code></pre>
					</div>
	
					<p>Example:</p>
					<div>
						<pre><code>
		# Iterating over a list
		fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
		for fruit in fruits:
		print(fruit)
						</code></pre>
					</div>
	
					<p>Here's how a <strong>while loop</strong> works:</p>
					<div>
						<pre><code>
		# Syntax:
		while condition:
		# Code block to be executed as long as the condition is true
						</code></pre>
					</div>
	
					<p>Example:</p>
					<div>
						<pre><code>
		# Printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop
		num = 1
		while num <= 5:
		print(num)
		num += 1
						</code></pre>
					</div>
					<p>Be cautious with loops to avoid infinite loops, where the loop condition is always true, causing the loop to run indefinitely.</p>

					Function declarations
				</header>
				<article>
					<p>In Python, functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to organize your code into smaller, manageable parts and promote code reusability.</p>
					<p>Here's how you declare a function in Python:</p>
					<div>
						<pre><code>
		def function_name(parameters):
		# Code block defining the function's behavior
		# May include statements, calculations, or other function calls
		return result  # Optional, used to return a value
							</code></pre>
					</div>
					<p>A function declaration consists of:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>def:</strong> Keyword indicating the start of a function declaration.</li>
						<li><strong>function_name:</strong> The name you give to your function, which should be descriptive of its purpose.</li>
						<li><strong>parameters:</strong> Optional input values (arguments) that the function can accept. These are enclosed within parentheses.</li>
						<li><strong>Code block:</strong> Indented block of code defining what the function does. This block may contain statements, calculations, or other function calls.</li>
						<li><strong>return:</strong> Optional keyword used to return a value from the function. If omitted, the function returns None.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Here's an example of a simple function:</p>
					<div>
						<pre><code>
		def greet(name):
			return "Hello, " + name + "!"
							
		# Calling the function
		message = greet("Alice")
		print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
						</code></pre>
					</div>
					<p>Functions are called by using their name followed by parentheses, optionally containing arguments. The value returned by the function can be stored in a variable or used directly.</p>
